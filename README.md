# TestBenchProject_Python
# The objective is to generate a Test Bench template for a Verilog Top module design, described in Python.
The program reads the Top file and extract the necessary information to fill in the created template. The
complete connection process with the module and inputs/outputs is designed and adapted to be simulated
in EDA PlaygroundÂ© environment. This program only works with traditional combinational Verilog
designs.
